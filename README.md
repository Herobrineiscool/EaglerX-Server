## Usage:
Run it in Gitpod
1) Go to (https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/catfoolyou/Eagler-Server)
2) In the console run `chmod +x ./main.sh`
3) Run `main.sh`
4) Go to the ports section and set them all to public (click the lock icon)
5) Copy the URL from port 25565 (replace https:// with wss:// or it won't work)
6) Connect to this url in your client (https://github.com/catfoolyou/EaglerX-Client)

## To run server commands:
In the "Console" tab in the replit, you can send server commands.

## To save progress:
**Notice: This is now done automatically, every 5 minutes, using a plugin!** In the server console or in-game as an opped player, run `/save-all` to save the world.
## DO NOT COMMIT CHANGES!!! Gitpod will save your server locally, your progress will not be lost.
## Too slow?
This is because you are using a free service to host a Minecraft server. Of course it is slow and the only way to fix this is to self-host at home.

### Cuberite doesn't allow for Bukkit/Spigot plugins.
